A car rental is a vehicle that can be used temporarily for a fee during a specified period .Getting a rental car helps people get around despite the fact they do not have access to their own personal vehicle or don't own a vehicle at all. The individual who needs a car must contact a rental car company and contract out for a vehicle. This system increases customer retention and simplify vehicle and staff management.
